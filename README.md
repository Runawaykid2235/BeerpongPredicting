Beerpong Predicting
Overview
Beerpong Predicting is a Python-based simulator designed to calculate odds for various events in a beerpong game. By simulating millions of matches, the tool provides probabilities for different outcomes based on player accuracies. This project is ideal for anyone interested in game simulations, probability calculations, or just having some fun with data.

Features
Simulate Beerpong Games: Input player accuracies for two teams and simulate matches to calculate odds.
Odds Calculated:
First team to toss the ball
First team to hit a cup
Total tosses (over/under)
